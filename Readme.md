### iBus (Working title!)

iBus is a work in progress app that has as its goal drastically simplifying the user experience of a commute app.

A problem with virtually all commute apps available at present is that they require far too many steps for the user to go through before they present the required information. The fact is that â€“most- people who use public transportation use the same routes to and from work. iBus takes as a given that you will always want to know the status of one particular route, from one particular stop. This means that after the initial user setup, it will be possible for the information the user needs (is my bus on time/am I going to make it to the bus stop) to be presented immediately on launching the app.

## How to use:

At this point there's very little to see. If for some reason the voices in your head are telling you that you need to see what's going on with the app, you can clone the repo, navigate to the folder with your terminal and run "npm run watch.js" and open up the index.html file in your browser.

## Updates Soon!
